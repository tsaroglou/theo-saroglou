        <h2>Altruistic Self-Image and Self-Deception: A Non-Monotonic Relationship</h2>
        <p>
            The study suggests that manipulating one's self-image can lead to self-deception, but this relationship is not straightforward. In situations where personal and altruistic motives conflict, the relationship becomes non-monotonic, meaning it can change direction based on the dominant motivation (either self-image or personal gain). The author introduces an experimental design that simulates these conflicting scenarios using monetary incentives, moral dilemmas, and self-image proxies.
        </p>
        <h3>Key Concepts & Theoretical Framework</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Belief-Based Utility:</strong> The paper builds on the idea that beliefs, beyond their accuracy, provide utility. This utility influences decision-making, often leading to self-deception when self-image or social-image concerns are present.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Motivated Cognition:</strong> Motivated cognition often arises from a desire to maintain or enhance self-image, and this study focuses on how it influences prosocial (altruistic) behavior.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Experiment Design</h3>
        <p>
            Participants made allocation decisions between themselves and a charity under two scenarios:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Win-Win Scenario:</strong> Maximizing personal and charity gains without conflict.</li>
            <li><strong>Moral Conflict Scenario:</strong> Personal gains reduce the charityâ€™s payoff, forcing a trade-off between self-interest and altruism.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Participants received ambiguous signals about which scenario they were in and were incentivized to report the scenario accurately. Self-deception was measured by how they interpreted ambiguous signals when self-image was at stake.
        </p>
        <h3>Findings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Non-Monotonic Relationship:</strong> The study shows that self-deception and self-image concerns do not have a linear relationship. When individuals face conflicts between personal gain and altruism, they either:
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Profit-Driven Self-Deception:</em> Underestimate altruistic scenarios when they prioritize personal gain.</li>
                    <li><em>Image-Driven Self-Deception:</em> Overestimate scenarios needing ethical judgment when they highly value self-image and altruism.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                The results suggest two distinct forms of self-deception based on what dominates (profit or image), resulting in a zero mean bias on average when aggregated.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Implications</h3>
        <p>
            The findings imply that self-deception varies based on the balance of motivations (altruism vs. personal gain). Understanding these dynamics is crucial for further research into belief-based utility and how people reconcile their actions with their self-image.
