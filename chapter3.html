        <h2>Merit Beliefs and Preferences for Redistribution: The Role of Expectations</h2>
        <p>
            The paper examines how people's belief in the meritocratic nature of income distribution affects their support for redistribution. This belief often leads to a "winner's bias," where those who benefit from the system justify inequality by attributing their success to merit. The study introduces expectations as a factor, measuring how people's anticipated performance and the accuracy of those expectations impact their redistributive preferences. When people’s results don’t meet their expectations, they may attribute the outcome to luck. This serves to protect their self-image, influencing their support for redistributive policies.
        </p>
        <h3>Experimental Design</h3>
        <p>
            The experiment involved a test where participants received scores affected by varying levels of noise (uncertainty). Participants made predictions about their performance and later voted on redistribution levels after seeing their scores. By manipulating the noise level, the experiment explored how ambiguity influences self-serving interpretations of merit and luck.
        </p>
        <h3>Key Findings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Expectations and Redistribution:</strong> Participants whose scores fell short of their expectations were more likely to vote for higher redistribution, suggesting that unmet expectations trigger self-serving biases where individuals attribute outcomes to luck. However, in order to deploy motivated thinking, a noisy signal was required.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Types of Motivated Thinkers:</strong> The study differentiates between naive and sophisticated motivated thinkers:
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Naive Thinkers:</em> Bias was mainly driven by their scores.</li>
                    <li><em>Sophisticated Thinkers:</em> Bias was influenced by how well their performance matched their expectations.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Group vs. Personal Merit Beliefs:</strong> Beliefs about personal merit often overshadow beliefs about group merit when determining redistributive preferences.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Implications</h3>
        <p>
            Understanding the role of self-image and expectations in shaping redistributive attitudes offers insights into public support for policies aimed at reducing inequality. The paper suggests addressing these biases through education or policy framing could promote more equitable redistribution.
