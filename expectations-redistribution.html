Expectations, Merit Beliefs, and Redistribution Preferences</h2>

         <h3>Background and Motivation</h3>

    <p>
       The research builds on existing literature demonstrating that individuals who attribute income inequality to merit are less likely to support redistribution, while those who believe luck plays a role in outcomes tend to favor higher redistributive policies. Often, the winners of the income distribution hold stronger meritocratic beliefs than their less privileged counterparts, resulting in lower preferences for redistribution. This experiment specifically explores the cognitive mechanisms behind these preferences, focusing on how individuals adjust their beliefs about merit and fairness based on whether their performance meets their initial expectations.
    </p>

    <p>
        The study examines how people’s redistribution preferences are shaped by their own expectations and self-beliefs in a controlled setting that isolates the effect of self-image concerns. By removing direct monetary incentives, the study aims to reveal whether beliefs about fairness and merit influence redistribution preferences solely to protect self-image.
    </p>
    <h3>Experimental Design</h3>
    <p>
        The experiment involved three main groups: a control group and two treatment groups with different levels of “noise” affecting participants’ performance scores. In the Profitable Noise treatment, noise in the grading mechanism increased scores randomly, resulting in an advantage for participants, while the Neutral Noise treatment added noise without consistently benefiting or harming participants. In the control group, no noise was introduced, allowing scores to reflect participants' actual test performance.
    </p>
    <p>
        Participants first set initial expectations by predicting their own performance on a Raven’s Progressive Matrices test. This prediction served as a baseline self-belief, allowing the study to capture discrepancies between expected and actual performance. Participants then took the test, after which they were given feedback on their scores and asked to vote on a redistribution rate that would only affect payments for other participants.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Findings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Attribution of Success to Merit or Luck:</strong> Participants who exceeded their expectations in the Profitable Noise treatment were more likely to attribute their high performance to personal merit and voted for lower redistribution rates. Conversely, participants in the Neutral Noise treatment who scored lower than expected attributed their results to luck, leading them to vote for higher redistribution rates. This aligns with the concept of self-image maintenance, where individuals favor explanations that protect their self-worth.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Role of Expectations and Cognitive Biases:</strong> Participants who entered the experiment with high expectations were more likely to demonstrate confirmation bias if their performance met or exceeded these expectations. The figure below illustrates that overconfident participants who expected high scores but underperformed tended to support higher redistribution, possibly as a means of attributing outcomes to external factors like luck.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Personal vs. Group-Level Beliefs:</strong> The experiment further distinguished between personal merit beliefs and group merit beliefs, showing that participants could attribute personal outcomes to luck or merit while holding different beliefs about the fairness of the group’s distribution. For example, some participants perceived their performance as a product of merit but viewed the group distribution as luck-driven, leading to differing redistribution preferences at the personal and group levels.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Self-Serving Beliefs and Winner’s Bias:</strong> The study found that participants who outperformed their expectations displayed a "winner’s bias," ascribing success to their own merit. This bias persisted even without monetary incentives, suggesting that self-serving beliefs about merit can be driven by self-image concerns alone. This finding reinforces prior research on winner’s bias, highlighting its robustness in the absence of financial motivations.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cognitive Sophistication and Belief Adjustment:</strong> The study also observed differences in belief updating between naive and sophisticated thinkers. While naive participants were more likely to adjust beliefs based solely on performance scores, sophisticated thinkers considered both their scores and the alignment between their actual performance and initial expectations. This finding underscores the role of cognitive sophistication in belief manipulation, suggesting that more cognitively advanced individuals may be more adept at sustaining positive self-images even when results do not fully align with expectations.

    <h3>Implications</h3>
    <p>
        The results underscore the importance of self-image in shaping economic preferences, suggesting that beliefs about merit and luck are not simply rational responses to outcomes but are also influenced by a need to maintain a positive self-image. This finding has implications for policy-making, particularly in contexts where public support for redistribution is essential for policy implementation. Policies that highlight the role of systemic inequality or the impact of external factors on individual success could potentially reduce winner’s bias and foster greater support for redistributive measures.
    </p>
    <p>
        The study also suggests that efforts to mitigate self-serving biases should address cognitive factors that drive belief-based biases. For instance, educational programs that encourage accurate belief updating and reduce overconfidence could help individuals adopt a more balanced perspective on inequality and merit. This approach could lead to greater empathy for others’ economic circumstances, ultimately supporting fairer redistributive policies.
    </p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        In conclusion, this study provides critical insights into the psychological drivers of redistribution preferences, revealing how self-image concerns and motivated reasoning contribute to beliefs about merit, fairness, and inequality. By isolating the role of expectations in winner’s bias, the experiment demonstrates that individuals adjust their beliefs about success and fairness to protect self-image, even in the absence of financial incentives. The findings highlight the nuanced relationship between personal and group merit beliefs, showing that self-serving biases can operate at multiple levels.
    </p>
    <p>
        These insights advance our understanding of economic behavior, suggesting that individuals’ attitudes toward redistribution are shaped not only by rational considerations of fairness but also by cognitive mechanisms that support a favorable self-image. In light of these findings, policies aimed at fostering social equity should consider the cognitive and psychological factors underlying winner’s bias and other belief-based biases, paving the way for a more inclusive approach to addressing inequality.
